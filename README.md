# Billion Dollar Movie Analysis


## Introduction

The goal of this project was to figure out what type of movie Microsoft should make, and when they should make it. While the files provided did have great information on the movie industry, it did not have everything I needed.

Because the data from IMDB did not contain any user reviews, I needed to web scrape from the Rotten Tomatoes website using Request and BeautifulSoup so see what the people are saying about each movie.

For the analysis and visualizations pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn were used.

The results below are from analyzing user reviews for over 2000 movies.

## Objectives
* What month returns the most profit?
* What day of the month returns the most profits?
* What genres produce the most billion dollar grossing movies?
* What genre do people most often leave positive reviews?

## Actionable Insight
#### Make an Animated Action/Adventure Movie!
* If Microsoft is trying to make a Billion dollar movie this data shows that the way to make that happen would be to create an Animated Action/Adventure movie.

* This data was taken from user reviews sentiment analysis to show that Action Adventure and Comedy are the movie genres that people enjoy the most.

#### Make it a Summer Hit!
* The data shows movies that premier in June make the most profit

#### Third week of June release date!
* The most profitable day to premier is the 22nd of the month, but between all of the billion dollar grossing movies the averge premier date is the 14th. The third week of June is a good target time frame.

## Recommendations 

* Investing in the GCI Budget could yeild great returns similar to what was seen with Frozen and Minions merchandise.

* If the characters have an exciting comforting design that kids would want on their backpacks, then we will have nailed this one!

* Mold the story to be one that can be marketed to all children, but adults would also be interested in the story as the titles mentioned above did so well.

## Future Work

* In the hunt for a billion dollar movie I would like to see if there is any conection between specific actors and billion dollar grossing movies.

* Refrence streaming service data to see how it compares to user review data. Are people only watching the shows they say they like?
