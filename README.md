# Billion Dollar Movie Analysis


## Introduction

The goal of this project was to figure out what type of movie Microsoft should make, and when they should make it. While the files provided did have great information on the movie industry, it did not have everything I needed.

Because the data from IMDB did not contain any user reviews, I needed to web scrape from the Rotten Tomatoes website using Request and BeautifulSoup so see what the people are saying about each movie.

For the analysis and visualizations pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn were used.

The results below are from analyzing user reviews for over 2000 movies.

## Objectives
* What month returns the most profit?
* What day of the month returns the most profits?
* What genres produce the most billion dollar grossing movies?
* What genre do people most often leave positive reviews?

## Actionable Insight
* Make an Animated Action/Adventure Movie!
    *  If Microsoft is trying to make a Billion dollar movie they need to capitalize on the Action/Adventure genre's constant popularity along with the popularity of animated movies in this category.

    * This data was taken from user reviews sentimetn analysis as well as movie profit calculations.
* Make it a Summer Hit!
    * The data shows movies make the most money if they premier in June.
* Third week of June release date!
    *The most profitable day to premier is the 22nd of the month, but between all of the billion dollar grossing movies the averge premier date is th 14th. The third week of June is a good target time frame.
